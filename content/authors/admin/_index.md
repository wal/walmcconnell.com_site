I'm a data scientist and software engineer based in Dublin, Ireland :shamrock:. I'm facinated by the complexity, ambiguity and challenge of building really successful SAAS products. I work as part of the Analytics & Data Science team at [Intercom](https://intercom.io) where I help product and engineering leadership research and operationalise the commercial, adoption and engagement metrics needed for building :ok_hand: SAAS products.

Before all this finance and product :bar_chart: stuff, I was a software engineering leader building massive scale data processing systems. I also spent time working with elite sports organisations helping them think about how analytics can help optimize sporting performance.

I'd :heart: to hear from you, please drop me a note via the messenger, or the social links below!
